# ü¶Ä Rust Fundamentals Playground

This project serves as a comprehensive collection of Rust code examples, designed to explore and demonstrate core language features, control flow mechanisms, functions, modules, and closures. It's a hands-on learning resource for understanding Rust's robust and efficient programming paradigms.

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Control Flow Mastery**: Dive into `if-else if-else` statements, `while` loops, infinite `loop` constructs with `break`, and `for` loops for iterating over collections.
*   **Function & Module Organization**: See practical examples of defining functions and structuring code into separate modules for better organization and reusability.
*   **Closure Explorations**: Understand how closures work in Rust, including their ability to capture and mutate variables from their enclosing scope.
*   **Basic Type Demonstrations**: Examples showcasing various Rust data types like integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, tuples, and arrays.
*   **Input/Output Interaction**: Simple examples of reading user input from the standard input.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, you can install them using `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/Rust_book.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Rust_book
    ```
3.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
    This command compiles the project and its dependencies.

## üí° Usage

To run the main examples, execute the project from the root directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

The `main.rs` file contains calls to various demonstration functions, many of which are currently commented out to allow for focused execution. You can uncomment specific function calls within `main()` to test different features:

*   `println!("Hello Rust , Olujimi Adebakin!");` - A basic "Hello World" message.
*   `test_closures();` - Executes the `wingman_app` and `test_closure` functions from `src/closures.rs`, demonstrating closure behavior.

To explore specific features:

1.  **Open `src/main.rs`** in your preferred editor.
2.  **Uncomment** the line corresponding to the feature you want to test (e.g., `test_if();` for conditional logic, `test_while();` for while loops, etc.).
3.  **Run** `cargo run` again to see the output.

**Example: Testing `test_if()`**

Uncomment `test_if();` in `main.rs`. When you run `cargo run`, the program will prompt you to enter an age and demonstrate conditional logic based on driving age rules.

**Example: Exploring `helpers.rs` functions**

Uncomment lines like:
```rust
// let myresult: String = helpers::name_helpers::get_full_name("jimi", "adebakin");
// println!("Hello from: {}", myresult);
//
// let my_num: i8 = helpers::api_helpers::get_age_plus_5(30);
// println!("my_num is: {}", my_num);
```
These calls will demonstrate how to use functions defined in other modules.
