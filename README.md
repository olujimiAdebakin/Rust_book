# **Rust Fundamentals Playground 🦀**

## Overview
This project serves as a practical showcase for foundational Rust language concepts. It demonstrates essential syntax, variable declarations, type casting, and the usage of various primitive data types, tuples, and arrays. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand Rust's core features.

## Features
*   ✨ **Variable Declarations**: Explore immutable and mutable variable declarations using `let` and `let mut`.
*   🔢 **Type Casting**: Witness explicit type casting between numeric types, specifically `f64` to `u8`.
*   🧠 **Primitive Data Types**: Practical examples of `f64` (float), `u8` (unsigned 8-bit integer), `bool` (boolean), `char` (character), and `&str` (string slice).
*   📦 **Tuples**: Understand how to group values of different types into a single compound type.
*   📏 **Arrays**: See how fixed-size lists of elements of the same type are defined and used.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

*   📥 **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd rust_code
    ```
*   🛠️ **Build and Run**:
    Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, you can get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
    Navigate into the project directory and execute:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

### Environment Variables
This project does not require any specific environment variables to run.

## Usage
Once the project is built and run using `cargo run`, the program will execute the `main` function, which in turn calls `test_func`. The console output will display the results of various variable assignments, type conversions, and data structure printouts, illustrating Rust's type system in action.

**Expected Console Output Example:**

```
Hello Rust , Olujimi Adebakin!
y value is: 190
Initial value: true
i_am_old is: false
mystr is: A
first_name is: Olujimi, last_name is: Adebakin
my_tuple is: (500, 6.4, 1, "adebakin", true, 40)
ages array is: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```
