# **Rust Core Concepts Demo** ðŸ¦€

This project serves as a foundational exploration into the core concepts of the Rust programming language. It demonstrates basic syntax, data types, control flow, and module organization through a series of small, illustrative examples.

## Features âœ¨
- **Data Type Exploration**: Demonstrates primitive types like integers, floats, booleans, characters, and strings, along with tuples and arrays.
- **Control Flow**: Implements an `if` statement to illustrate conditional logic based on user input.
- **Module Organization**: Showcases how to structure code into separate modules (`helpers.rs`) for better organization and reusability.
- **Function Definitions**: Includes examples of defining and calling functions with various parameters and return types.
- **User Input Handling**: Integrates basic standard input for interactive command-line operations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/Rust_book.git
    cd Rust_book
    ```
2.  **Build the Project**:
    Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, follow the official Rust installation guide.
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
    This command compiles the project and its dependencies.

## Usage

To run the main application, use the `cargo run` command. The application will prompt you to enter an age, demonstrating basic control flow.

```bash
cargo run
```

Example Interaction:
```
Hello Rust , Olujimi Adebakin!
Enter the person's age:
20
Issuing drivers license, because they are old enough
```

You can also uncomment sections within `src/main.rs` to explore other examples, such as:
-   `test_func()`: Demonstrates type casting, mutable variables, primitive data types, tuples, and array slices.
-   Calls to helper functions like `helpers::name_helpers::get_full_name` and `helpers::api_helpers::get_age_plus_5` to see module imports and function usage.
